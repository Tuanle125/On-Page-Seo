               <h1>5 Things to Know Before Buying Land to Build a House</h1>
                  <p>Building a custom home is a dream for many, but before construction can commence, you have to purchase the land. Our tips on buying land to build a house can simplify the process and eliminate unwanted surprises.</p>
                  <p>Buying land to build a house is more complex than it might initially seem. For many, having a home built to their specifications is the culmination of many years of poring over house plan magazines and driving through neighborhoods looking at existing houses for design inspiration.</p>
                  <p>However, the building process is multifaceted, and the lot or land chosen for construction must meet certain specifications. Whether you long for a rural pastoral view with no neighbors in sight or you’re more interested in choosing a lot on a cul-de-sac, there are things to consider when buying land to build a house. The land you purchase lays the foundation for the entire construction process.</p>
               <h2>1.  You may need to pay for the land in cash.</h2>
                  <p>Mortgage lenders are less likely to loan money for raw, undeveloped land than for an existing house because there are too many unknowns with raw land. This is especially true for large plots of rural land because it can be cost-prohibitive in many cases to bring electrical power to the site and make provisions for a driveway, potable water, and a suitable sewer system.</p>
                  <p>The upside is that if you can pay for the land in cash, the lender is more likely to finance the construction of a new house. Suppose you own the land or lot outright (without a loan). In that case, the lender may consider your ownership as a down payment for construction financing, which can later be transferred into a traditional mortgage at the end of the building process.</p>
                  <p>The exception to this general rule is when you purchase a lot in a residential development where homes are currently under construction because the lender knows the developer has already taken care of the technical details. With a suitable down payment (the amount can vary by lender), you may be able to finance a platted lot and the cost of building a house in a single construction loan that will later roll into a mortgage when the house is move-in ready.</p>

               <h3>Step 2: Research the type of house you want</h3>
                  <p>There are three types of builds available; spec homes, tract homes, or a fully custom home.</p>
               <h4>Spec (speculative) homes</h4>
                  <p>Spec homes are single-family homes that are built in a development with no particular buyer in mind.</p>
                  <p>If you go under contract early enough on a spec home, you may be able to choose some features like flooring, paint, kitchen appliances, and other finishes.</p>
               <h4>Tract homes</h4>
                  <p>Tract homes are when a developer buys a large plot of land and divides that land into individual lots. They’ll then construct homes from specific architectural options planned for that community.</p>
                  <p>Tract homes could include single-family homes, condos, or townhomes.</p>
               <h4>Custom homes</h4>
                  <p>A custom home is where you have your own plot of land and hire a builder to build a house exactly the way you want it.</p>
                  <p>Russell Wing, a top-selling agent who has sold 83% more single-family homes than the average agent in Union County, North Carolina, shares insight on the benefits of a custom home.</p>
                  <p>“It’s easier to build a custom because you have more choices. You can build the house from the bottom up and in the way you want — you’ll have to pay accordingly. With a spec home, your options are limited. Contractors may only offer shades of white or certain cabinets. They’re basically cookie-cutter homes.”</p>

               <h3>Step 3: Research and hire the building team</h3>
               <p>Building a home is a huge project, and the average build will involve 22 subcontractors working on the home.</p>
               <p>The first person you’ll need to hire is the general contractor or a custom home builder. They will oversee the construction of your home from start to finish. Their duties include:</p>
               <p>Note: Custom home builders and general contractors are not the same thing, but they are very similar. A custom home builder draws up blueprints for the home and specializes in custom homes, whereas a general contractor does not.</p>
